            <p>NSS is mandatory for all freshers of NIT-T and included as a part of their academic curriculum. Volunteers have to complete designated hours in NSS to attain their passing grade. Every department has a session every week - organised by Executive Committee Members and Program Officers based on various topics and knowledge sharing sessions. </p><br>
            <p>We also promote and execute government schemes like Jal Shakthi, Ek Bharath Shrestha Bharath, Swach Bharath, and conduct awareness sessions on personal hygiene and practices. As a part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Scheme, NSS Volunteers regularly teach the children of REC middle school located inside the NIT-T campus. As a team, NSS also ensures that villages adopted by NIT-T get all needs, whichever can be done by the NSS NIT-T unit. </p>
